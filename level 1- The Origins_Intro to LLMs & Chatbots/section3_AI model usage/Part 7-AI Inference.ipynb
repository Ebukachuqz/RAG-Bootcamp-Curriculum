    "1. **Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Gather huge amounts of raw data (text, images, audio).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Feed data to the model. It learns patterns by adjusting internal settings (parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation**\n",

    "   * Test how well the model performs on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fine-Tuning (Optional)**\n",

    "   * Further train the model on specialized datasets for specific tasks.\n",

    "5. **Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Put the model into an app, API, or tool where people can use it.\n",
